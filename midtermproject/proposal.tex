\begin{solution}
    Summary: 
    I want my midterm project to be participation in the following Kaggle competition using anisotropic kernels to determine visual glitches faces in video frames in forged videos.

    Deepfake detection challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/

    Data: 470 GB of video files, with the label 'fake' or 'real'

    Method:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extract all frames from videos

    \item Extract all faces from frames using MTCNN or similar face detection model
    \item Create embedding vectors per face per frame
    \item Given point clouds consisting of embedding vectors, calculate prob(video is fake | face embedding vectors, trained weights)

        I want to calculate this probability using the maximum mean discrepancy metric and some kernels that rescale the data according to local covariance of the data (i.e., create basis functions that are shaped according to provided data, rather than e.g. Gaussian balls)


    \end{itemize}

Inspired by:

Two-sample Statistics Based on Anisotropic Kernels
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05006

A witness function based construction of discriminative models using Hermite polynomials 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02975

Evaluation metric: log loss of predictions

Possible challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model must run in $<$ 9 hours on Kaggle hardware
    \item Face detection models typically are not trained on fake faces, so might misbehave
    \item Videos may contain multiple faces
    \item Part of the challenge is detecting forged voices also, so I must find a way to incorporate that information as well
\end{itemize}
\end{solution}

% Add pairs of problems and solutions as needed
