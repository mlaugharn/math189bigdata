I want my midterm project to be participation in the following Kaggle competition:

Deepfake detection challenge
https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data

Data:
470 GB of video files, separated by fake and real

Method:
Using anisotropic kernels to determine visual glitches in video frames that correlate to fake data

Inspired by:

Two-sample Statistics Based on Anisotropic Kernels
https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05006

A witness function based construction of discriminative models using Hermite polynomials 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02975
